U.S. Police Violence Impact Factors research

Racial prejudice and discrimination have existed for a long time in the United States, which is a profound historical and cultural problem. In this project, we pay attention to the record of American police shooting suspects. We used various charts to visualize the data and clearly compare different factors. Also, different classification models are used to fit the data to help us make a conclusion. The purpose of our project is to judge from the model training results whether racial prejudice affects the violent law enforcement and the process of related cases being brought to trial.
